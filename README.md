# Generic Tictactoe
Basically TicTacToe with n number of grids (1≤n≤10) rather than just 3

### So what is this about
When all my friends and classmates were writing TicTacToe, I thought we are programmers - to genericise is in our blood - why not genericise Tictactoe - rather than just the same 3 grid let's write the same program for n grids and ofcourse we would a put a cap as to how high should n be. I wrote the program and my generic program was in fact smaller and faster than others - however I donot take pride on that cause they were not from the C.S. background like I was.

<b>P.S.</b> Only after I wrote the entire program did I realise that it is absolutely not enjoyable to play tictactoe at number of grids other than 1- because of that I skipped the plan to write "generic" AI for the game and I even dropped the plan of writing a 3D tictactoe (something only one in a million could imagine -- just kidding)
